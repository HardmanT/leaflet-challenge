Earthquake Visualization Project
This project visualizes M2.5+ earthquakes from the past 30 days using Leaflet and D3.js.

Overview
This web application fetches earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API and displays it on an interactive map using Leaflet. Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker, with its size indicating the magnitude and its color indicating the depth. Additionally, a legend is provided to help interpret the map's visual cues.

Features
Interactive map displaying earthquake data
Circle markers representing earthquakes, with size indicating magnitude and color indicating depth
Popup information for each earthquake marker
Legend providing context for map data
Zoom and pan controls for map navigation
